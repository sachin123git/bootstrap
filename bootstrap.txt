2)  What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

ANS
A Bootstrap Container is a fundamental component used in Bootstrap to create a responsive layout for web pages.
It provides a fixed-width container that holds the content of the webpage and helps in maintaining the overall structure and responsiveness of the design.

The container class in Bootstrap is used to create a container. There are two types of containers in Bootstrap:

1. `.container`: This class creates a responsive fixed-width container. The width of the container adjusts according to the screen size. 
On larger screens, it has a maximum width set to a specific pixel value, while on smaller screens, the container adapts to the available width.

2. `.container-fluid`: This class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. 
It expands to fill the available space across different screen sizes.


 3)  Default Bootstrap Text Settings:
Bootstrap provides several classes to modify the appearance of text. Some of the default text-related classes include:

1. `.text-left`: Aligns the text to the left.
2. `.text-right`: Aligns the text to the right.
3. `.text-center`: Centers the text horizontally.
4. `.text-justify`: Justifies the text.
5. `.text-nowrap`: Prevents the text from wrapping.

Bootstrap Grid System:
The Bootstrap Grid System is a responsive, mobile-first grid system that allows you to create a flexible and responsive layout for your web page. It is based on a 12-column grid, where you can divide your page horizontally into rows and vertically into columns. 
The grid system enables you to easily create responsive designs by specifying how many columns each element should occupy on different screen sizes.

Difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5:
Bootstrap 5 introduced several notable changes and improvements over Bootstrap 4, including:

1. Dropped jQuery dependency: Bootstrap 5 removed the dependency on jQuery, resulting in a smaller file size and improved performance.

2. Replaced JavaScript plugins with vanilla JavaScript: JavaScript plugins in Bootstrap 5 are rewritten in plain JavaScript, reducing the reliance on external libraries.

3. Added new utility classes: Bootstrap 5 introduced a new set of utility classes that provide more flexibility in styling and layout options.

4. Enhanced grid system: The grid system in Bootstrap 5 received updates to provide more layout options, such as vertical alignment utilities and gap utilities.

5. Improved customization: Bootstrap 5 offers better customization options, allowing developers to easily modify the framework's default styles.

Button Group:
A Button Group in Bootstrap is a set of buttons that are grouped together visually. It helps in presenting related actions or options as a cohesive unit. The class used to create a basic Button Group is `.btn-group`.

Using Bootstrap to make thumbnails:
To create thumbnails using Bootstrap, you can use the `.card` class. A thumbnail typically consists of an image, along with some additional content. Here's an example of how you can create a thumbnail using Bootstrap:

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Thumbnail Image">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Thumbnail Title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Thumbnail description.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Button</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

This code creates a card with an image at the top, a title, description, and a button within the card's body. The `card-img-top` class ensures that the image is positioned at the top of the card.

Flexbox in Bootstrap 4:
In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox is a CSS layout module used for building flexible and responsive layouts. It provides a set of utility classes that allow you to easily create flexible containers and align elements within them. Flexbox helps in creating dynamic and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

Creating an alert in Bootstrap:
To create an alert in Bootstrap, you can use the `.alert` class. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  This is a primary alert.
</div>
```

You can replace `.alert-primary` with different classes to use different alert styles, such as `.alert-success`, `.alert-info`, `.alert-warning`, or `.alert-danger`. The `role="alert"` attribute is used for accessibility purposes.

Bootstrap Card:
A Bootstrap Card is a flexible and customizable content container. It provides a structured way to display various types of content, such as images, text, links
